BlogSlider
Dan Vega


This plugin was written as a demo for my cfObjective 2011 presentation "Writing your first jQuery plugin".
BlogSlider is a good example of a slider plugin that shows off some core concepts of plugin development. A 
big thanks to Doug Neiner, Ben Nadel and Steve Withington for their help reviewing the code.
